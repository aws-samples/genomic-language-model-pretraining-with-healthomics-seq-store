## Genomic language model pretraining with the HealthOmics sequence store

In this repo we show how to use genomic language models on the AWS cloud.

A genomic language model is a type of machine learning model, typically based on architectures like transformers or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), that is trained to understand and generate sequences of DNA, RNA, or other biological sequences. Just as language models are trained on human text to predict and generate natural language, genomic language models are trained on nucleotide sequences (like those composed of the bases A, T, C, and G) to capture the underlying patterns and structures in genomic data.

We show here, how to work with two genomic language models: [HyenaDNA](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-29-hyena-dna) and [Evo](https://arcinstitute.org/news/blog/evo).
